-----
6/4-6/8:
Tasks:
- Read paper with background information, load data into R.

Files: 
- genes.RData: original TCGA data
- gene_list: specify which gene is somatic/germline
- v1.RData: with processed and cleaned dataset from TCGA, associated with somatic_matrix.R
-----
6/11:
Files:
- somatic_count.csv: matrix(row: patient ID, col: somatic gene type) of mutation count
- somatic_binary.csv: similar as above, matrix of whether the gene mutates
- somatix_matrix.R: clean and subset the data from TCGA to create a matrix stated above
-----
6/12:
Files:
- sampleID: specify which patient code is corresponding to which tumor type
-----
6/13:
Tasks: 
- Map patient code with corresponding cancer type. 
- calculate the proportion matrix(see description of correlation.R)

Files:
- correlation.R: create the proportion matrix of how much percent does the gene mutate in one cancer
- type.csv: modified version of somatic_binary.csv. matrix(row:corresponding cancer type to patient ID, col: somatic gene type)
-----
6/14:
Tasks:
- Create heatmap from ratio matrix
Files:
- ratio_table.csv: matrix of ratio of mutated gene in each cancer type
-----
6/15:
- heat_original: heatmap of ratio_table by alphabetical order
- heat_cluster: heatmap of ratio_table by hierarchical clustering order
